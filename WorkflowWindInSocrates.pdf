\begin_layout Standard
This document contains a reasonably detailed description of the development
 of algorithms for processing data from the pitot-static sensor and the
 gust pod on the GV during SOCRATES\SpecialChar endofsentence
 That development does not need much
 elaboration in this document, but some functions were developed in the
 process of constructing this document and some supporting explanation will
 help anyone wanting to duplicate or extend this work to understand how
 they operate.
 This workflow therefore focuses mostly on those functions and a few related
 aspects like the sources of data used in the report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Sources of Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this time, only the data files produced in the field during the SOCRATES
 project are available.
 These are labeled as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Preliminary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and should not be used for final analyses, so it will be important to revisit
 this analysis when final production files are available.
 In the meantime, to facilitate reproducibility, subset data files as used
 by this program are saved in the EOL directory ~cooperw/RStudio/Reprocessing,
 with the names AKRDdata.Rdata, AKRDforSOCRATES.Rdata, 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

DataM.Rdata, and AKRD-fit-coef.Rdata.
 These files are too large to include in the GitHub repository, and EOL
 data-access rules prevent that until the data are released for public access
 so only internal-to-EOL personnel with responsibility for data processing
 for the project should use these files until they are released in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Production
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format..
 The program has the code to reconstruct these files from the temporary
 EOL data repository (/scr/raf_data/SOCRATES, etc.), and later could do so
 from the released data files.
 The data files may change as EOL personnel review them and correct errors
 in or make changes in processing (e.g., perhaps by reducing the presence
 of spikes in the high-rate data that affect variance spectra); that is
 one reason for caution when using these data files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Special Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some functions were isolated to the 'chunks' directory because they were
 expected to be of further use, for example by processing routines that
 implement the algorithms recommended in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WindInSOCRATES
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 report.
 Some will be incorporated into the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ranadu
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 package of R routines in the future, and others are re-used in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

QAtools
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 shiny app that provides temporary data processing during and shortly after
 the field project for quality assessment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
VSpec(.data, .Variable)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Plots of spectral variance (often called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

variance spectra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here) are used extensively in this report, so a separate function was used
 to facilitate construction of those plots.
 In its simplest form, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

VSpec
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 constructs a frequency-weighted variance spectrum from a single variable
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.Variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 contained in a supplied data.frame (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) and returns a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ggplot2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 plot specification suitable for printing.
 The returned specification can also be saved so that subsequent calls can
 add additional spectra to the plot.
 This usage would follow these forms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
VSpec(Data, 'TASX')    ## a single spectrum
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
## for three spectra on one plot:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
g <- VSpec (Data, 'QCF')
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
g <- VSpec (Data, 'QCTC', ADD=g)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
VSpec (Data, 'QC_GP', ADD=g)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A set of default specifications will be used in that case.
 A description of the available parameters and options is contained in the
 header information for the function.
 It is planned that this function will be included in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ranadu
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, at which time the normal help command for the function (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

?Ranadu::VSpec) will provide information on the options and defaults.
 In the meantime, the following will serve as a partial description of the
 function:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be a data.frame containing the variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.Variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as one among possibly many columns.
 The data.frame must also contain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable and should have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 attribute; this is the case for all data.frames constructed by Ranadu::getNetCDF.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.Variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be specified as a character variable containing the name of the
 variable (e.g., .Variable='TASX')
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default variance spectrum is constructed using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectrum()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function of R\SpecialChar endofsentence
 This function accepts a smoothing argument named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

span
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with a default value in VSpec() of 49.
 This can be changed by setting the calling argument via spans=NewValue.
 In effect, centered-average values of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spans
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 length are averaged to produce a smooth spectrum, so larger numbers produce
 more smoothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The routine will also produce a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maximum entropy method
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (MEM) spectrum if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

type
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument is set to anything other than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spectrum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the default).
 In this case, the Ranadu functions memCoef() and memEstimate() are used
 to construct the spectrum.
 Two additional arguments are relevant in this case: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the number of poles to use in the MEM estimate), with default value 50,
 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which specifies the fraction of the logarithm of the frequency range)
 between successive evaluations of the MEM estimate of spectral variance,
 with default value 0.0001 leading to evaluation at 10,000 discrete frequencies.
 A small number of poles gives a smoother spectrum; a small value for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resolution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is needed to identify possible sharp spikes in the spectrum.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Additional smoothing can be provided for either type of spectrum by specifying
 a value for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

smoothBins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument.
 The default is 0, and this value or any other value less than or equal
 to 9 leads to no smoothing.
 For other values, the spectrum is binned into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

smoothBins
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 bins evenly spanning the displayed logarithmic frequency range and spectral
 estimates are averaged within each bin before the plot is constructed.
 Often a value of 50 or 100 is useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is a faint orange background of lines in the generated plot that represent
 a -5/3 logarithmic slope or, for the frequency-weighted spectrum, a -2/3
 slope.
 For measurements representing components of the wind (like WIC or VYC)
 the reference lines are constructed so that there is a factor-of-10 difference
 in eddy dissipation rate between the lines and the line representing 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-4}\mathrm{m^{2}s^{-3}}$
\end_inset

 is shown as a heavier dotted line.
 This uses a default value of a parameter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ae
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 0.2.
 This should be changed to ae=0.15 for a longitudinal spectrum like TASX
 or UXC to shift the reference lines to account for the expected 4:3 ratio
 between the expected magnitudes of the longitudinal and lateral spectra
 in an inertial subrange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An additional argument 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

VLabel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be used to change to label used in the legend for the specified variable.
 The default is the name of the supplied 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.Variable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This can be useful to supply a more descriptive name than the short name
 used in the netCDF file; for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

VSpec (Data, 'UXC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, VLabel='longitudinal wind component [m/s]').
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The final argument is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ADD
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with default value NA.
 If this argument is supplied, it should provide a variable containing a
 previously defined ggplot2 specification of a plot, in which case the new
 spectrum will be added to the existing plot.
 This can be used to plot up to four variance spectra on a single plot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default ggplot2 theme is used unless you specify another.
 I usually add 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theme_WAC()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the final plot specification before plotting to use the theme I prefer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future modifications may add the capability to plot the spectrum generated
 by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bspec::bspec()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which divided the spectra into segments and averages the spectra from
 the segments in order to reduce the variance in the estimate, following
 the method developed (I think) by Welch.
 It would be desirable to add options to change the axis limits and y-axis
 label as well, so this may be part of the eventual Ranadu function.
 For this report, however, the version residing in the directory 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and saved in the GitHub repository with this archive file was used.
 For additional information on variance spectra and the R routines used,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
MergeMatt()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function was used to combine the processed line-of-sight beam speeds
 in Matt Hayman's processing into the standard netCDF file produced by normal
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nimbus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 processing, optionally processed also by the Python script 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LAMS_ARISTO.py
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 discussed below.
 The reason for needing a special step (vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

normal data.frame merging) was that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variable in Matt's file was not the usual variable used in nimbus-produced
 netCDF files because it lacked data information, so some additional processing
 was needed to revise the time variable.
 This function was only used once and the resulting merged data.frame was
 saved for future use, so this is suppressed in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WindInSOCRATES.Rnw
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file by use of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eval=FALSE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

merge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 program chunk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
processWind()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function was used to calculate wind from the LAMS-provided beam speeds.
 It used the variables 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

V_LOS_Beam{1,2,3,4}
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 produced by Matt Hayman, although it would optionally use the beam speeds
 produced by the Python routine using Savitzgy-Golay polynomials.
 As used, this function produced the wind vector in cartesian coordinates
 from beams 1–3 and did not use beam 4, which was generally weak and questionabl
e in this project and was not included in Matt Hayman's processing.
 Once a relative-wind vector was determined from the LAMS beam speeds, that
 vector was combined with the CMIGITS measurements of attitude angles and
 Earth-relative aircraft motion to calculate the wind and return a data.frame
 with variables representing the airspeed and wind components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
AddWind(DF)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function implements the processing developed in this report by adding
 new wind variables based on the pitot-static sensor and, separately, on
 the gust pod.
 There are several additional arguments that can control which variables
 are added, but all are TRUE by default and so add all these results to
 the supplied data.frame.
 All of these rely on the Ranadu function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WindProcessor()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The arguments to AddWind(), in addition to the data.frame, are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
addAKY: Add the angle of attack based on the complementary-filter algorithm
 described in Section 1.2 of the report, with the name 
\series bold
AKY\SpecialChar endofsentence

\series default
 This option also adds a variable 
\series bold
WIY,
\series default
 the vertical wind calculated using the new angle-of-attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
addGP: Add the wind measurements based on the gust pod, using the empirical
 representation developed in this report.
 The new variables are 
\series bold
AK_GP, SS_GP, TASG, WDG, WSG, WIG, UXG, VYG,
\series default
 representing respectiveley the angles of attack and sideslip, the airspeed,
 the wind direction and speed, the vertical wind, and the longitudinal and
 lateral components of the horizontal wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
addTC: Add wind measurements and a new airspeed measurement based on measurement
s from the pitot-static sensor.
 New variables are 
\series bold
TASTC, WDTC, WSTC, WITC, UXTC, VYTC, 
\series default
with meanings analogous to the basic measurements with X or C suffixes in
 place of TC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
addROC: Add a rate-of-climb variable 
\series bold
ROC 
\series default
representing the vertical speed of the aircraft as determined by integration
 of the hydrostatic equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, it is possible to supply a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument to handle the case where the data.frame does not have this attribute.
 If this attribute is included in the data.frame, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Rate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 argument is overridden by the value of the attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function is also used by the QAtools shiny app to support the addition
 of these variables to a netCDF file.
 The function itself does not do this; it only adds these variables to the
 R data.frame.
 The routine also makes use of SplitDV() so that function must be available
 when it is called.
 It also uses several Ranadu functions so that package should be available
 when it is called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
removeSpikes(v)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To support the removal of spikes, this routine calculates the rolling mean
 and standard deviation (width 99) of a variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

v
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, identifies values of the variable that differ from the rolling mean by
 more standard deviations than a limit specified by sdLimit (default 4),
 and replaces those values by interpolation in the returned variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
The Python routine LAMS_ARISTO.py
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This routine is replaced now by Matt Hayman's processing, especially now
 that his variables include a measure of uncertainty, so this routine will
 likely not be used in the future and it is not essential to the production
 of the present report.
 Nevertheless, the following provides some documentation in case it is ever
 needed again, because for this work it had to be retrieved from a previous
 version and modified, involving considerable work that might be reduced
 by the following guide to how to use this routine:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On tikal, copy the routine ~cooperw/ARISTO-2017/LAMS_ARISTO.py to another
 directory where you have write permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On lines 254 and 255, change the names of the data file and the directory
 containing the file to be processed.
 Do not include the trailing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.nc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the file name.
 Save the edited file.
 CAUTION: This routine will create a new file in that same directory as
 the existing file with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LAMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 appended to the file name, and if that file is present it will be overwritten.
 This won't overwrite Matt's files because it adds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LAMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_LAMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but if his files ending in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_LAMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are used the new file will end in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_LAMSLAMS
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In that case, the new file will contain the line-of-sight speeds obtained
 by both algorithms, in Matt's case with the names Beam1_LAMS – Beam4_LAMS
 and in the case of the Python program with names BEAM1speed – BEAM4speed.
 Note, however, that these were not used in the present report except, when
 present, for comparison tests.
 Instead, Matt's variables 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

V_LOS_Beamx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (with x={1,2,3}) were be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run the program using the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

python LAMS_ARISTO.py
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There will be regular messages during processing, ending (if successful)
 with the message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Reached end of routine ...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This will typically take a few minutes, maybe as much as 5 min.
 If this fails immediately, there may be a problem with the available python
 packages that need updating or changing.
 In particular, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

netCDF4
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 python package must be present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On successful completion, there should then be a new file with a name ending
 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LAMS.nc
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the prescribed working directory.
 It should be slightly larger than the original file because a few variables
 are added containing the line-of-sight LAMS speeds and some derived quantities.
 These are then the netCDF files that were read by the next routine (the
 processor associated with this document) to produce the final document,.
